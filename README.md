# ORE Network - Block Producer Documentation


The Open Rights Exchange (ORE) Protocol provides a simple and flexible way for developers to add rights/access control, identity, and payment to any application.

The protocol runs on the ORE Network - a secure EOS sister-chain that is hosted by a decentralized network of independant block producers.

This documentation is for ORE block producers and those interested in joining the network.   



## Block Producer Agreement

The ORE Network is an EOS sister-chain that runs an unmodified version of [EOSIO blockchain](https://github.com/eosio). However, ORE is not a general-purpose chain. Users cannot deploy smart contracts to the chain. Instead, the chain is only used to house EOS user accounts and to trade 'rights tokens' that provide access to a digital asset (or the right to call an off-chain, ORE-enabled API). These Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) can be owned and transfered between users. 

ORE Block producers agree to run a few additional off-chain 'Oracle' services including one that validate these 'rights tokens' and enable calls to off-chain APIs.

[Block Producers Agreement](./bp-agreement.md) - All ORE Block Producers agree to abide by these guidelines 

## Technical Requirements

[ORE Block Producer Technical Requirements](./bp-technical.md) - 
ORE Block Producers should run a minimum hardware configuration and launch their chain using the provided configuration and Genesis file(s)
